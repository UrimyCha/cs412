    Ramsay's TV persona is defined by his fiery temper, aggressive behaviour, strict demeanour, and frequent use of profanity, while making blunt, 
    critical, and controversial comments, including insults and sardonic wisecracks about contestants and their cooking abilities. He combines 
    activities in the television, film, hospitality and food industries, and has promoted and hired various chefs who have apprenticed under his wing. 
    He is known for presenting television programmes about competitive cookery and food, such as the British series Hell's Kitchen.
